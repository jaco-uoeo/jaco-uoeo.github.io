# Personal Development Plan

Lately, with my current MSc project, I’ve felt the pressure of juggling work, study, and everything in between. I’ve noticed I end up cramming or skimming through material without really absorbing or applying it. That’s why I’m leaning into a Professional Growth Plan—it gives me a way to step back, see the bigger picture, and build consistency. Instead of just reacting to deadlines, I can be intentional with how I use my limited time. It’s not about doing more—it’s about making what I do count, learning deeply, and actually growing through this process, not just surviving it.

## Skills Matrix

| Skill Area               | Current | Target | Why It Matters                                             | Micro-Focus Area                                     |
|--------------------------|---------|--------|------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| Focus / Distraction Mgmt | 2       | 4      | I don’t have time to waste on distractions               | Work in “flight mode” blocks                         |
| Time & Energy Mgmt       | 2       | 4      | Keeps me consistent without burnout                       | Protected MSc time + recovery                        |
| Strategic Reading        | 3       | 5      | Smarter reading → better ideas, faster learning            | 2 focused articles/papers/week + highlight key takeaways |
| ML Application Practice  | 2       | 5      | Applying things makes it stick (plus builds a portfolio)| Weekly mini-projects, 1–2 hours/week                |

## Monthly Review

1. What did I learn or apply this month?  
2. What distracted me most often?  
3. Is my 2-hour routine working, or do I need to adjust?  
4. What’s one small experiment I can try next month?
