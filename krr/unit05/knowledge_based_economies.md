# Exploring the Knowledge-Based Economy
{: .hidden-title }

## Introduction
These activities explore how knowledge shapes different fields, from economics to advanced technology. The first activity looks at the idea of a knowledge-based economy, focusing on how data, innovation, and human skills drive growth and development. The second activity examines a technical system, Tree-GPT, which uses a structured knowledge base to improve the analysis of forest data through AI.
These activities highlight the importance of organised knowledge in making smarter decisions and solving complex problems. They show how knowledge supports progress, whether at a national scale or within specialised technology.


## Activity 1: Defining a Knowledge-Based Economy

### Brief
Read the article by El Khatib *et al* 2023. How does the author define a knowledge based economy?

### Thoughts

El Khatib *et al.* (2023) describe a knowledge-based economy as one that relies on knowledge, innovation, and technology to grow. Unlike traditional economies, it focuses less on natural resources and more on human capital, education, and data. The authors stress the role of ICT, research, and lifelong learning in driving development and improving productivity.

The article highlights how the UAE is shifting toward this model. Initiatives such as Smart Dubai and Vision 2021 demonstrate a clear focus on leveraging technology and data to drive progress. The government is collaborating with the private sector and research institutions to build a stronger, smarter economy.

A key point made is that knowledge now holds more value than labour or materials. The economy benefits when data and innovation guide decisions. The UAE’s use of predictive tools and AI is helping improve services and support sustainable growth.

The article presents the knowledge-based economy as a modern, forward-looking approach. It shows how countries can prepare for the future by investing in people, ideas, and digital tools. The case of the UAE provides a real-world example of how this transformation can occur.

## Activity 2: Understanding Knowledge Bases in Tree-GPT

### Brief
Read the article by Du *et al.* 2023 and answer the following questions:
- What is a knowledge base?
- How is a knowledge base applied in the system discussed in this paper?

### Thoughts

In the paper by Du *et al.* (2023), a knowledge base is described as a carefully organised store of information specific to a particular domain—in this case, forest remote sensing and ecological data. It holds facts, rules, and parameters that describe forest environments, such as tree species characteristics, growth patterns, and environmental factors. This structured information acts as a foundation for the system to understand and process complex questions related to forest analysis.

The Tree-GPT system utilises this knowledge base as a core component to enhance its interpretation and analysis of remote sensing images. When a user inputs a natural language query or request, such as asking the system to identify tree types or analyse forest health, Tree-GPT consults the knowledge base to find the relevant ecological and forestry parameters. This helps the system understand the context and the specific requirements of the task.
Using the knowledge base, Tree-GPT then generates accurate and context-aware code that performs the data analysis on the remote sensing images. The knowledge base ensures that the system’s responses are grounded in real scientific data, which improves the reliability and precision of the results. Without this structured information, the system would struggle to produce meaningful insights because it wouldn’t have access to the domain-specific details necessary to interpret complex forest data correctly.

Overall, the knowledge base in Tree-GPT acts as both a reference library and a guiding framework. It allows the AI to move beyond generic language understanding and perform specialised tasks with expert-level knowledge. This integration of a knowledge base with a large language model is key to making Tree-GPT a powerful tool for forest remote sensing analysis, combining the strengths of data-driven AI and domain expertise to support interactive and accurate forest monitoring.
