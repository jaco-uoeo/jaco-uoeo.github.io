# Knowledge Representation and Reasoning

As part of my exploration into key areas of Artificial Intelligence, this section focuses on the Knowledge Representation and Reasoning (KRR) module. The module explored foundational concepts, principles, and frameworks in KRR, providing both theoretical insight and practical experience. 

I engaged with various tools and methodologies that not only deepened my understanding but also enabled me to envision future developments in the field. Through hands-on activities and critical analysis, I gained skills essential for applying KRR in real-world AI solutions. This portfolio reflects my growth and understanding of KRR as a vital component of intelligent systems and advanced AI applications.
