# Activity 1 & 2 – Knowing vs Having Information  
{: .hidden-title }

## Introduction

This activity focuses on distinguishing between *knowing* something and simply *having information* about it. Based on an exercise from Kendal and Creen’s *Introduction to Knowledge Engineering* (2007), it highlights the importance of how information is processed and used. In knowledge engineering, this distinction is critical because intelligent systems need to do more than store data—they must interpret and apply it effectively.



## Activity 1: Categorising Everyday Situations

The following categorisation applies to the scenarios provided, with explanations for classifying each as either “knowing” or “having information”:

**a. A second language in which you are fluent** – *Knowing*  
  Fluency in a language involves more than memorising vocabulary or grammar; it requires the ability to use language naturally in various contexts.

**b. The content of a television news programme** – *Having information*  
  Recalling facts from a news programme generally represents information unless the content has been deeply analysed or connected to prior knowledge.

**c. A close friend** – *Knowing*  
  Knowing a close friend implies understanding their personality, behaviours, and values through ongoing interaction and experience.

**d. A company’s annual report** – *Having information*  
  Unless possessing specific financial expertise, reading an annual report usually means having access to data without full comprehension of its implications.

**e. Your close friend’s partner whom you have yet to meet** – *Having information*  
  Information about this person is second-hand and lacks the depth that direct interaction provides.

**f. The weather on the other side of the world** – *Having information*  
  Weather data from a distant location is received externally and is not directly experienced.

**g. The weather where you are now** – *Knowing*  
  Experiencing local weather directly allows for contextual understanding beyond mere data.



## Activity 2: Distinguishing Knowing from Having Information

The primary distinction between *knowing* and *having information* lies in the ability to contextualise and apply understanding. Knowing involves interpreting facts in context and using them to explain, predict, or make decisions. Conversely, having information is more passive, involving possession of facts without deeper comprehension or application.

Kendal and Creen (2007) describe knowledge as enabling intelligent action, emphasizing that knowledge-based systems require more than data storage—they need reasoning capabilities.



## Conclusion

This exercise underscores the difference between information and knowledge, an essential concept in knowledge representation. Effective intelligent systems must be able to move beyond data collection to interpret and act upon information in meaningful ways.
