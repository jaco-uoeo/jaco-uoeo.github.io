# Intelligent Agents

Intelligent agents are systems that can perceive their environment, make decisions, and act autonomously to achieve specific goals. They're a core aspect of artificial intelligence, enabling flexible, adaptive solutions to complex problems. This module's overarching learning outcomes included the following elements:

- Understand the motivations behind agent-based computing and when it's appropriate to apply it.
- Explore key agent models and their roots in artificial intelligence research.
- Gain hands-on experience developing, deploying, and evaluating intelligent agent systems in real-world contexts.
- Engage with current research topics and challenges in the field of intelligent agents.
