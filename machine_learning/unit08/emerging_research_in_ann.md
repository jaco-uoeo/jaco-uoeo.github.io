## Using ANNs for Insurance Products: Ethical considerations 

In reflecting on the 2019 snapshot paper from Centre of Data Ethics and Innovation (CDEI) it is clear that as AI becomes more common in insurance, it's important to think carefully about how it's used. One big concern is privacy — AI systems often rely on large amounts of personal data, and people may not always know what's being collected or how it's used. There’s also the risk of unfair treatment. If the data behind the AI is biased, the decisions it makes might be too — potentially making some people seem riskier than they really are, or even uninsurable.

Another issue is transparency. Many AI models are complex and difficult to explain, so customers might not understand why a claim was denied or why their premium went up. This can lead to frustration and a lack of trust.

Then there's the matter of influence. AI can be used to guide or "nudge" people toward safer or healthier behaviour, which sounds good — but if done without consent, it could feel intrusive or manipulative.

Finally, if something goes wrong, who’s responsible — the insurer or the tech? As the industry continues adopting AI, it will need to strike a balance: using these tools to improve services while being fair, transparent, and respectful of people’s rights.
