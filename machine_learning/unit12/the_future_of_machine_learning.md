## Predictive Models for Industrial Prognostics in Industry 4.0

Out of the different types of prognostic models used in Industry 4.0, I found predictive models particularly effective—especially when applied to digital twins. These virtual models mirror the behaviour of physical systems in real time, and predictive modelling gives them the ability to look ahead and anticipate future outcomes. Compared to descriptive models that explain what’s already happened, or prescriptive models that suggest possible actions, predictive models offer a practical middle ground—they’re easier to implement and already make a noticeable impact in real-world systems.

In areas like manufacturing or facilities management, predictive models help digital twins forecast things like equipment failure or performance dips. For example, in building management, a digital twin of an air circulation system can use predictive analytics to estimate when a filter might need replacing or when airflow might decrease, allowing maintenance to be scheduled before a system failure occurs. I found this especially interesting, as it turns the digital twin from a static monitor into a proactive tool.

This aligns with what Diez-Olivan et al. (2019) highlight in their review—predictive models are a key enabler for Industry 4.0, offering strong support for maintenance planning, system optimisation, and overall operational efficiency.
